# PORTFOLIO
project

So this is my portfolio website for module CTEC3905.

On the website you can find bunch of different stuff I've done over the years, including artwork, music videos etc.

Read forward if you want to read about the process of bulding the site.

First I researched different websites with the similar layout. I wanted to create something simple yet practical.

I made the HTML basically from the ground up by myself. We had gone through Bootstrap in my University so I decided to with that since it's simple and easy to use and makes the webpage mobile ready basically automatically. 

As you can see from the index.html file, there's only 136 rows of code (to be honest, could be less but I like to keep things nice and organized with breaks)

I used simple div elements for the content on the site and a cheeky little blur effect on the pictures which is done with CSS.

We were required to use Javascript for the page so I added a simple contact form on the contact.html page. This was done with Javascript and I found the template online, did a bit of CSS to alter it to my liking. Didn't go through PHP to actually make it work, but I guess that's ok. 

There you guys have it, hopefully you click through the links to see my work and hopefully enjoy it too. This was fun to make and I'm planning on keeping it for possible future work endeavours!
